# 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle

The AirBnB project is a big part of the Higher level curriculum. This project helped me be ready for it.

## In this project, I reviewed everything about Python:

Import
Exceptions
Class
Private attribute
Getter/Setter
Class method
Static method
Inheritance
Unittest
Read/Write file
I also learned about:

args and kwargs
Serialization/Deserialization
JSON


#### Learning Objectives
* At the end of this project expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- General
What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
How to serialize and deserialize a Class
How to write and read a JSON file
What is *args and how to use it
What is **kwargs and how to use it
How to handle named arguments in a function
