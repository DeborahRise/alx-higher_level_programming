# Python - Test-driven development

### Background Context
Don’t trust the user, always think about all possible edge cases

##### Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, I was able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- What’s an interactive test
- Why tests are important
- How to write Docstrings to create tests
- How to write documentation for each module and function
- What are the basic option flags to create tests
- How to find edge cases
